                Like all x-rays, the CT-scan also uses x-rays that expose the patient to ionizing radiation. 
                Ionizing radiation has the potential risk to cause biological mutations in living tissue and the risk increases with the number of exposures over the life of an individual. 
                However, the risk of developing cancer due to x-ray radiation exposure is generally small. 
                CT scans for pregnant women poses no known risk to the baby if the area of the body scanned is not the abdomen or pelvis. 
                In the event where an imaging of the abdomen or pelvis is needed, practitioners generally use alternative methods that do not expose the patient to radiation such as ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
                Contrast agents are used in CT scans to easier identify soft tissues which may allow x-rays to pass through to varying ability. 
                The contrast agents contain substances that can block the x-rays allowing for better visualization on an x-ray image. 
                In some cases, certain patients may have an allergic reaction or even rarer cases, temporary kidney failure to the contrast agents. 
                Practitioners should not administer these contrast agents to patients with abnormal kidney functions which can cause severe predicaments. 
                Children also have a higher relative risk of developing cancer from x-ray radiation compared to adults due to them being more sensitive to ionizing radiation and having a longer life expectancy. 
                Practitioners should adjust the machine setting in accordance with the children.

            <p class="ctscan-text">                
                The ECG is classified as a Class II medical device as the test is safe and painless. 
                The test is non-invasive and only comes into contact with the surface of the skin with no electricity being conducted to the body of patients.
