            <p class="ctscan-text">
                Computed tomography is an x-ray imaging procedure that utilizes x-rays projected through a narrow beam that is aimed at the patient and rotated quickly around the body. 
                The CT scanner’s computer then receives the signals and processes them to generate cross-sectional images. After a sufficient amount of cross-sectional images are collected, 
                they are then processed by the computer to produce a three dimensional (3d) image of the patient’s body. 
                Clinicians are able to obtain more detailed information of the patient's body through this method as compared to the standard X-ray. 
                This allows clinicians to have a clearer understanding of as well as easier identification of any issues or abnormalities within the patient’s body. 
                The CT scanner utilizes a donut-shaped structure called a gantry and a bed positioned in the center of the circular opening of the structure. 
                The gantry consists of a motorized x-ray source that rotates around the bed and a set of specialized digital x-ray detectors which are positioned at the direct opposite end of the x-ray source.
                During a scan, the gantry rotates as the patient laying on the bed slowly moves through it and as the beam of x-ray travel through the patient, 
                they are picked up by the detectors and sent to the computer. After each full rotation, the computer uses a complex algorithm to create a two-dimensional image. 
                The thickness of tissue is usually represented ranging from1 – 10 millimeters depending on the different CT machine. 
                The bed moves through the gantry again and this process is repeated until a sufficient amount of images are produced. 
                The computer is then able to generate a 3D image of the patient’s body in different systems such as skeleton, muscles, organs, or any other abnormalities.
                This enables physicians to rotate and visualize the 3D image for easier diagnosis.

            <p class="ctscan-header">Electrocardiograph (ECG)</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                The ECG is a device used to examine and monitor how the heart functions. It is primarily used to record the heart rate (frequency of heart beats) and heart rhythm (how regularly the heart beats). 
                The device is often used to diagnose and monitor any heart conditions that may be affecting the heart. The ECG can help detect arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), coronary heart disease (blockage of blood supply to heart), heart attacks (myocardial infarction). 
                The ECG is usually carried out using sensors called electrodes that are stuck to the surface of the skin to measure the electrical activities of the heart. 
                The standard 12 lead ECG uses ten electrodes, six placed on the chest, and one each on the lower arms and calves. 
                The electrodes are stuck onto the skin using adhesive gel and they are connected to the ECG machine using cables. The ECG then converts the signals received into an ECG graph. <br><br>
                A regular ECG wave shows the first peak (P wave) which represents the electrical impulse spreading across the two atria of the heart. 
                After the atria contracts, pumping blood to the ventricles and relaxes, the electrical impulse then travels to the ventricles. 
                This is represented as the Q, R and S waves, called the QRS complex. The ventricles contract. 
                The final wave is the T wave which shows that the electrical impulse has stopped travelling leading to the ventricles relaxing again. <br> <br>
                <b>Types of ECG test:</b> <br>
                <u>Resting ECG:</u> which involves the patient lying calmly and comfortably still on their back with their chest bare. 
                The ECG is then taken over the next few minutes while the patient is in a relaxed state. <br>
                <u>Exercise ECG:</u> which involves the patient having their ECG taken in a physically active state. 
                The level of intensity of exercise increases steadily and the ECG is recorded. The test will stop prematurely if any irregularities occur in the ECG. <br>
                <u>Holter monitor:</u> Where the ECG is taken over a period of 24 hours with three or four electrodes attached to the chest and a miniature recording device hung around the belt or neck. 
                The data is then recorded and transmitted to the doctor’s computer for analysis. The doctor also needs the patient’s daily schedule as this allows them to check if there are any irregularities during certain time intervals. <br>
