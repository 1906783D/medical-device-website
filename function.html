            <p class="ctscan-header">CT Scanner</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                Computed tomography is an x-ray imaging procedure that utilizes x-rays projected through a narrow beam that is aimed at the patient and rotated quickly around the body. 
                The CT scanner’s computer then receives the signals and processes them to generate cross-sectional images. After a sufficient amount of cross-sectional images are collected, 
                they are then processed by the computer to produce a three dimensional (3d) image of the patient’s body. 
                Clinicians are able to obtain more detailed information of the patient's body through this method as compared to the standard X-ray. 
                This allows clinicians to have a clearer understanding of as well as easier identification of any issues or abnormalities within the patient’s body. 
                The CT scanner utilizes a donut-shaped structure called a gantry and a bed positioned in the center of the circular opening of the structure. 
                The gantry consists of a motorized x-ray source that rotates around the bed and a set of specialized digital x-ray detectors which are positioned at the direct opposite end of the x-ray source.
                During a scan, the gantry rotates as the patient laying on the bed slowly moves through it and as the beam of x-ray travel through the patient, 
                they are picked up by the detectors and sent to the computer. After each full rotation, the computer uses a complex algorithm to create a two-dimensional image. 
                The thickness of tissue is usually represented ranging from1 – 10 millimeters depending on the different CT machine. 
                The bed moves through the gantry again and this process is repeated until a sufficient amount of images are produced. 
                The computer is then able to generate a 3D image of the patient’s body in different systems such as skeleton, muscles, organs, or any other abnormalities.
                This enables physicians to rotate and visualize the 3D image for easier diagnosis.

            <p class="ctscan-header">Electrocardiograph (ECG)</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                The ECG is a device used to examine and monitor how the heart functions. It is primarily used to record the heart rate (frequency of heart beats) and heart rhythm (how regularly the heart beats). 
                The device is often used to diagnose and monitor any heart conditions that may be affecting the heart. The ECG can help detect arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), coronary heart disease (blockage of blood supply to heart), heart attacks (myocardial infarction). 
                The ECG is usually carried out using sensors called electrodes that are stuck to the surface of the skin to measure the electrical activities of the heart. 
                The standard 12 lead ECG uses ten electrodes, six placed on the chest, and one each on the lower arms and calves. 
                The electrodes are stuck onto the skin using adhesive gel and they are connected to the ECG machine using cables. The ECG then converts the signals received into an ECG graph. <br><br>
                A regular ECG wave shows the first peak (P wave) which represents the electrical impulse spreading across the two atria of the heart. 
                After the atria contracts, pumping blood to the ventricles and relaxes, the electrical impulse then travels to the ventricles. 
                This is represented as the Q, R and S waves, called the QRS complex. The ventricles contract. 
                The final wave is the T wave which shows that the electrical impulse has stopped travelling leading to the ventricles relaxing again. <br> <br>
                <b>Types of ECG test:</b> <br>
                <u>Resting ECG:</u> which involves the patient lying calmly and comfortably still on their back with their chest bare. 
                The ECG is then taken over the next few minutes while the patient is in a relaxed state. <br>
                <u>Exercise ECG:</u> which involves the patient having their ECG taken in a physically active state. 
                The level of intensity of exercise increases steadily and the ECG is recorded. The test will stop prematurely if any irregularities occur in the ECG. <br>
                <u>Holter monitor:</u> Where the ECG is taken over a period of 24 hours with three or four electrodes attached to the chest and a miniature recording device hung around the belt or neck. 
                The data is then recorded and transmitted to the doctor’s computer for analysis. The doctor also needs the patient’s daily schedule as this allows them to check if there are any irregularities during certain time intervals. <br>

            <p class="ctscan-header">Electroencephalograph(EEG)</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                The function of an electroencephalograph (EEG) is to record electrical activity of the brain. 
                It is generally used to monitor and diagnose brain disorders or any conditions affecting the brain. 
                It is most commonly used to diagnose epilepsy or other kinds of seizure disorders. 
                Other less often use of the EEG might help in diagnosing or treating: brain tumors, Brain trauma from head injury, sleep disorders, brain inflammation, stroke, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease.
                A continuous EEG is used to monitor the depth of anesthesia during a medically induced coma. During a EEG procedure, small metal discs called electrodes are attached to the scalp of a patient, primarily to detect the electrical activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex.
                An EEG typically does not record the activity of single neurons but rather detects signals created by large groups of neurons that are active at the same time. 
                It mostly records signals from small parts of the brain surrounding each electrode. 
                The EEG graph provides an image of electrical activity in the brain represented as waves of varying frequency, amplitude, and voltage. 
                It can measure the brain activity during an event like executing a task, the presentation of a stimulus or to measure abnormalities like spontaneous brain activity that happens in the absence of a specific event. 
                The activity that occurs in association with an event is called the Event-Related Potential (ERP). 
                Even though the EEG have many advantages such as its relative low cost and capability to measure brain activity on the order of milliseconds, there are some limitations that exist. 
                Such limitations include the inability to pinpoint activity seen using the EEG to a precise spatial location in the brain due to the fact that it monitors activity in large groups of neurons and the limited capability to accurately record activity from deeper parts of the brain beyond the cortex.

        <div class="ctscan-box">
            <p class="ctscan-header">Electromyography(EMG)</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                It is the study of muscle electrical signals and there are a variety of clinical and biomedical applications.
                Clinical applications include diagnosis for neuromuscular diseases, lower back pain assessment, kinesiology, motor control disorders and biomedical include assisting in developing EHW chip for prosthetic hand control.
                It is a diagnostic procedure that records the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles to evaluate the health and function of muscles and the nerves cells (motor neurons) that control them and reveals nerve dysfunction, muscle dysfunction or problems with nerve-to-muscle signal transmission.
                The EMG is frequently done with a nerve conduction study (NCS) which measures the amount and speed of conduction of an electrical impulse through a nerve before it reaches the muscle. 
                While an EMG measures the response of muscles to electrical activity and the amount of electrical activity produced during a muscle contraction.
                Both procedures help to detect the presence, location and extent of injury/diseases that damage the nerve cells and muscles.
                The EMG uses small needle electrodes that are inserted through the skin into the muscles to record electrical activity.
                Muscles usually do not produce electrical signals during rest. 
                The Motor neurons send electrical signals to the muscles (signals originating from brain) This stimulates electrical activity in the muscles causing them to contract. 
                Muscle contraction itself also produces electrical activity. 
                After the insertion of the electrode the physician may ask the patient to perform an action to contract the muscle such as lifting or bending of the limbs. 
                Electrical activity is then picked up and displayed on an oscilloscope (a monitor that displays electrical activity as waveforms).
                The recorded readings are then analyzed by physicians to look for any signs of issues. 
                Muscles that are damaged may have abnormal electrical activities during rest. 
                Abnormal waveforms may also show up during contraction.
                Signs that may indicate a need for an EMG include tingling, numbness, muscle weakness, muscle pain or certain types of limb pain.

        <div class="ctscan-box">
            <p class="ctscan-header">Pulse Oximeter</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                    The Pulse oximeter is a fast and non-invasive monitoring device that measures the oxygen saturation (oxygen level) in the blood. 
                    This is accomplished by shining light at specific wavelengths through tissue, most commonly done at the fingernail bed.
                    Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb light at different wavelengths, 940nm and 660nm respectively.
                    The absorbed light is then processed by an algorithm in the pulse oximeter to display a value indicating then saturation.
                    Used to monitor oxygen levels for patients receiving anesthesia.
                    Usually a small, electronic clip-like device that is attached onto a part of the body, most commonly the fingertip. Other sites include the earlobe, forehead, nasal alar and lips.
                    The device then detects arterial pulsations in the arteriolar and capillary tissue beds. 
                    This is achieved by the device emitting light that passes through the fingernail, skin, tissue, 
                    and blood and on the other side lies a detector that senses the amount of light that passes through the finger without getting absorbed by tissue and blood.
                    A normal resting oxygen saturation level is generally between 95% and 100% for a healthy person at sea level. 
                    The oxygen saturation level may be slightly lower at higher elevations. Oxygen saturation reading drop below 92% may indicate a sign of hypoxia (condition where not enough oxygen reaches the body’s tissues) <br> <br>

                    Situation where the pulse oximeter is used to monitor and check the oxygen level in the blood: <br>
                    •	During or after any procedures where anesthesia is used such as surgery <br>
                    •	Monitor patient’s blood oxygen saturation when they are on certain medications that may reduce respiration and impair lung functions. <br>
                    •	Check a person’s ability to handle increased activity levels. <br>
                    •	Evaluate if a ventilator is needed to assist a patient with breathing. <br> 
                    •	Investigate if a person has moments when they stop breathing during their sleep (sleep apnea) <br> <br>

                    The pulse oximeter is also used to monitor the health and lung function of a patient with conditions that affects the blood oxygen levels, including: <br> <br>
                    •	Heart attack (cardiac arrest) <br>
                    •	Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) <br>
                    •	Heart failure <br>
                    •	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) <br>
                    •	Anemia <br>
                    •	Lung cancer <br>
                    •	Asthma <br> 
                    •	Pneumonia <br> <br>

                    The primary advantages of the pulse oximeter are that it is non-invasive, fast and can provide near-immediate results. 
                    Additionally, the device allows for continuous monitoring and can be used over a long period of time to monitor a patient’s blood oxygen level. <br> <br>
                    At the same time, the limitations of the pulse oximeter are that it is less precise than conventional methods such as arterial blood gas testing. 
                    The device also does not provide information on the composition of other gases in the blood such as carbon dioxide as compared to other tests that directly does blood testing.

        <div class="ctscan-box">
            <p class="ctscan-header">Sphygmomanometer</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                The Sphygmomanometer is a medical device that measures the blood pressure. The device composes of <br>
                •	An inflatable rubber cuff that is wrapped around the arm <br>
                •	a measuring device that indicates the cuff’s pressure (column of mercury or a press meter/dial(manometer)) <br>
                •	a bulb pump that inflates the cuff and a valve that releases the pressure.  <br>
                •	A stethoscope is then used to listen to the arterial blood flow sounds. <br>
                When the heart beats, blood is forced through the arteries causing the pressure to increase, this is called the systolic pressure.  <br> <br>
                The following decrease in pressure then signifies the ventricles of the heart preparing for the next beat. This low pressure is the diastolic pressure.
                The blood pressure is taken by inflating the sphygmomanometer cuff well above systolic pressure, the valve is then opened, and the cuff pressure is slowly decreased. 
                When the pressure of the cuff equals to the arterial systolic pressure, blood starts to flow past the cuff, creating rapid blood flow and audible sounds.
                A stethoscope is then used to hear these sounds and the cuff pressure is recorded. 
                The blood flow sounds continue until the cuff pressure falls below the arterial diastolic pressure. 
                The pressure when the sound of blood flow stops indicates the diastolic pressure. 
                Blood pressure is measured in mmHg and displayed as ‘systolic blood pressure/diastole blood pressure’ mmHg. 
                Normal blood pressure values are around 120/80 mmHg. 
                Blood pressure values below 90/50 mmHg is considered low blood pressure (hypotension), while values above 140/90 mmHg is considered high blood pressure (hypertension). 
                If blood pressure values are 180/120 mmHg or higher is dangerously high and requires immediate medical attention. <br> <br>
                There are three types of sphygmomanometers: <br>
                <b><u>Digital sphygmomanometers</u></b> which are automatic, it provides blood pressure readings without the need for someone to operate the cuff or listen to the blood flow sounds. 
                It uses electronic sensors to measure the blood pressure and the readings are displayed on a digital monitor. 
                They are less accurate and healthcare providers use them for screening but use manual sphygmomanometers to validate readings in some situations. <br>
                <b><u> Manual sphygmomanometers</u></b> which consist of aneroid (dial) and mercury (column): <br>
                Aneroid sphygmomanometer: Does not use mercury and consists of a stethoscope that is attached to the cuff which is further attached to a dial gauge with tubing. 
                The gauge head has a mechanical part that converts cuff pressure to gauge pressure. 
                The device requires periodic recalibration to avoid faulty readings.
                Mercury sphygmomanometer: It consists of manually inflatable cuffs that are attached to mercury-infused tubes. 
                To ensure the accuracy, the device should be kept on a flat surface and set upright. The risk of this device is higher due to the presences of mercury in it. 
                The advantages of the mercury sphygmomanometer is the lifespan of the device, ease of use and no need for recalibration.  <br> <br>
                Procedures on how to use a sphygmomanometer: <br>
                •	To begin blood pressure measurement, using a blood pressure cuff of the appropriate size. 
                The length of the cuff bladder should be at least equal to 80% of the circumference of the upper arm. <br>
                •	Wrap the cuff around the upper arm with the bottom edge of the cuff placed one inch above the antecubital fossa. <br>
                •	The stethoscope is then lightly pressed over the brachial artery just below the cuff edge. 
                (the diaphragm is another location that can be used to measure the blood pressure) <br>
                •	Inflate the cuff to 180mmHg rapidly and release the air at a moderate rate (3mm/sec) <br>
                •	Listen with the stethoscope and observe the dial or mercury gauge. The first knocking sound is the systolic pressure and when the knocking sound disappears, that indicates the diastolic pressure. <br>
                •	Record the pressure of both arms and evaluate the difference. Note the patient’s position (supine), which arm was used and cuff size. <br>

        <div class="ctscan-box">
            <p class="ctscan-header">Ventilators</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                The mechanical ventilator is also known as a breathing machine. 
                The device is a form of life support that is used when the patient experiences respiratory failure, a condition that makes it very difficult for the patient to breathe or get enough oxygen into their blood. 
                The machine acts as bellows to move air in and out of the patient’s lungs. 
                A ventilator does not directly treat illnesses, but it stabilizes the patient while other treatments and medication help in recovery. A ventilator: <br> <br>

                •	Provides oxygen to the lungs. <br>
                •	Help remove carbon dioxide from the lungs. <br>
                •	Provides pressure to keep the small air sacks (alveoli) in the lungs from collapsing. <br> <br>

                Healthcare providers are to adjust the settings to control the amount and frequency of air being pushed into the lungs to meet the patient’s specific needs. <br> <br>

                Mechanical ventilators use positive pressure to push air into the lungs and positive pressure ventilation can be invasive or non-invasive. Types of mechanical ventilation: <br> <br>

                Invasive mechanical ventilation: Uses a tube placed into the airway and is connected to a ventilator. The tube can go through the mouth (intubation) or neck (tracheostomy). <br> <br>

                Non-invasive ventilation: Uses a face mask that is connected to a ventilator, strapped onto the head, and attached securely. The ventilator then pushes air into the lungs. <br> <br>

                Situations where the ventilator might be used: <br> <br>
                •	During surgical procedures where general anesthesia is used on the patient as it can make it difficult for the patient to breathe well enough on their own. <br>
                •	When patients have certain lung conditions or infections <br>
                •	In a medical emergency that blocks the airway or impairs breathing <br> 
                •	Certain brain injuries or conditions that might impair the brain from properly communicating with the rest of the body, this includes the lungs which functions primarily to breathe properly. <br> 
                •	If patients have any conditions that cause the blood to have too high of carbon dioxide concentration (hypercapnia) or not enough oxygen (hypoxemia) <br>
                •	To prevent patients from accidentally getting fluids into the lungs (aspiration) <br> <br>

                Specific conditions or illnesses that may require a mechanical ventilator include: <br>
                •	Acute Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) <br> 
                •	Pneumonia <br>
                •	COVID-19  <br>
                •	Other respiratory illnesses <br>
                •	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) <br>
                •	Stroke <br>
                •	Severe brain injury <br>
                •	Coma  <br>
                •	Anaphylaxis <br> <br>

                How a ventilators function: <br> <br>

                Healthcare providers will insert an endotracheal tube (ET tube) through the mouth or nose and into the windpipe (trachea). The tube is then connected to the ventilator. 
                The ventilator pushes a mixture of air and oxygen into the patient’s lungs to get oxygen into the body. 
                The device also holds a constant low pressure, called positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), to ensure that the air sacs in the lungs does not collapse. 
                The ET tube allows healthcare providers to remove mucus from the trachea by suction. <br> <br> 

                A tracheostomy procedure may be performed on patients with a blockage in the trachea. 
                A hole is made in the neck and trachea, then a breathing tube (tracheostomy tube) is inserted into the hole and connected to the ventilator. 
                The tube also can be left there for as long as needed. <br> <br> 

                Patients on ventilators may be given medications (sedatives or pain killers) to prevent them from moving and makes them feel more comfortable. <br> <br>

                Additional procedures that healthcare providers will perform to treat or prevent complications include: <br> <br> 

                Monitoring condition of the body with additional devices. This includes monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen levels. 
                Chest x-rays and blood tests may be taken to look at the lungs or oxygen/carbon dioxide levels. <br> <br>

                Suctioning to keep the airways clear. Healthcare providers will insert a catheter (thin tube) into the breathing tube to remove mucus. <br> <br>

                Medications such as aerosolized (spray) medications through the breathing tube. Usually works best when inhale in directly. 
                Healthcare providers will also give medication into the veins via an IV <br> <br>

                Nutrition is usually given in the form of liquid through a tube through the nose and into the stomach as patients on a ventilator and intubated cannot eat or drink normally. 
                Fluids are given through an IV in a vein as well. <br> <br>

                Mobilization will be done by healthcare providers to sit the patients up regularly or may even get them to stand and walk sometimes. <br> <br>

                Bronchoscopy is done to investigate the airways in the lungs. Healthcare providers insert a small lighted camera through the breathing tube and into the lungs. 
                Samples of mucus or tissue make be taken for analysis. <br> <br>

            <p class="ctscan-header">X-ray System</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that similarly to visible light belonging on the electromagnetic spectrum. 
                However, x-rays have higher energy and can pass through most objects include the human body. 
                Medical x-rays are used to generate images of tissues and different structures such as organs and bones inside the body. 
                X-rays travels from the x-ray source and passes through the body and gets picked up by an x-ray detector lying on the opposite side of the source. 
                An image will be formed with different structures represented as “shadows” inside the body. <br> <br> 

                Photographic film is one type of x-ray detector. There are many other types of other detectors that are used to produce digital media. 
                X-ray images that are produce from this process are called radiograph. <br> <br>
                
                In order to create a radiograph, the patient is positioned specifically for the part of the body being imaged is located between the x-ray source and the x-ray detector. 
                When the device is powered, the x-rays travel through the body and are absorbed in different amounts by different tissues and structures, depending on the radiological density of the tissue they pass through. Radiological density is determined by the density and atomic number of the material being imaged. 
                The bones are more radiologically dense therefore it readily absorbs x-rays and produce a high contrast on the x-ray detector. 
                This results in the skeletal structure appearing whiter than other tissues against the black background of a radiograph. 
                While other less radiologically dense tissues such as fat, muscle, and organs such as the lungs allow x-rays to pass through easily and are displayed in shades of gray on the radiograph. <br> <br>
                
                X-ray technology is used in a variety of diagnostic and treatment procedures. Diagnostic procedures include: <br> <br>
                
                X-rays radiography which detects bone fractures (bone x-ray:  study broken bones, dislocated joints and arthritis. 
                Bone x-ray images can also show signs of bone cancer or infection and spine x-ray observes bones and tissues in the spine), 
                certain tumors or other abnormal masses, pneumonia (chest x-ray: evaluation of heart lungs and bones at the chest), some types of injuries, 
                calcifications (abdominal x-ray: evaluation of kidneys, stomach, liver and bladder to diagnose conditions such as kidney stones and bladder stones), 
                foreign objects, or dental related complications (dental x-ray: evaluation of the teeth and gums, look for infection and check for cavities). <br> <br>
                
                Mammography which is a radiograph of the breast that is used to detect and diagnose cancer. 
                Tumors can appear as regular or irregular shaped masses that are somewhat brighter than the background on the radiograph. 
                The mammogram is also used to detect tiny bits of calcium called microcalcification which shows up as very bright specks on the mammogram. 
                Specific patterns of microcalcifications can indicate the presence of cancer. <br> <br>
                
                Computed tomography (CT) is a combination of the regular x-ray technology with computer algorithm processing to generate a series of cross-sectional images that can be later compiled to form a three-dimensional x-ray image. 
                CT images are more detailed than typical radiographs which gives doctors the ability to view structure in the body from different angles. <br> <br>
                
                Fluoroscopy which uses x-rays and a fluorescent screen to observe real time images of movement within the body or diagnostic processes such as following the pathing of injected or swallowed contrast agent. 
                Fluoroscopy is often used with radiographic contrast agents to view the beating heart, blood flow to the heart muscles and through blood vessels and organs. 
                Fluoroscopy with radiographic contrast agent to guide an internally threaded catheter during cardiac angioplasty (an invasive procedure that removes clogged arteries). <br> <br>
                
                X-ray technology used for treatment include: <br>
                
                Radiation therapy in cancer treatment: Uses X-rays or other types of high energy radiation to destroy cancer cells by damaging the DNA. 
                The radiation dose used for cancer treatment is much higher than radiation dose used for diagnostic imago7ing. 
                Therapeutic radio can come from a machine or from radioactive material placed inside the body close to tumor cells.  <br> <br>

            <p class="ctscan-header">Ultrasonic System for Diagnosis</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                Diagnostic ultrasound is a non-invasive medical imaging diagnostic procedure used to view inside the body. 
                Ultrasound uses probes called transducers that produces high frequency sound waves used to create and capture real-time images or videos of internal organs or other soft tissue such as blood vessels. 
                Most ultrasound exams use a transducer that is placed directly on the skin or inside a body opening. 
                A thin layer of gels is applied onto the skin to allow the ultrasound waves to be transmitted from the transducer through the gel and into the body. 
                However, probes may be placed inside the body via gastrointestinal tract, vagina, or blood vessels to optimize image quality. <br> <br>

                Diagnostic ultrasound can be further divided into sub-categories: <br>
                Anatomical ultrasound which produces images of internal organs or other structures. <br>
                Functional ultrasound which combines information such as movement and velocity of tissue or blood, softness or hardness of tissue and other physical characteristics with anatomical images to create information maps to assist doctors to visualize changes in function within structure or organ better. <br> <br> 

                A transducer can both emit ultrasound waves and receive the ultrasound echoes reflected back. 
                Ultrasound transducers have an active element called piezoelectric crystals that are able to produce sound waves when an electric field is applied and in reverse, produce an electric field when sound waves hit them. <br> <br>

                When an ultrasound scanner is used: <br>
                •	Transducer sends out a beam of sound waves into the body.
                •	Sound waves are reflected back to transducer by boundaries between tissues in the bath of the beam. <br>
                •	Echoes reflected hit the transducer and generate electrical signals that are sent to the ultrasound scanner. <br>
                •	The scanner calculates the distance from the transducer to tissue boundary using the speed of sound and time of each echo’s return. <br>
                •	The distances are then used to generate two-dimensional images of tissue and organs. <br> <br>

                Diagnostic ultrasound is not good for imaging bones or any tissues that contain air such as the lungs. 
                Under some conditions, ultrasound can image bones (fetus or small babies) or lungs and lining around lungs, when they are filled or partially filled with fluid. 
                One common use of ultrasound is to monitor the growth and development of the fetus during pregnancy. 
                Other uses include imaging the heart, blood vessels, eyes, thyroid, brain, breast, abdominal organs, skin and muscles. <br> <br>

                Common ultrasound imaging procedures include:  <br>
                •	Abdominal ultrasound (to visualize abdominal tissues and organs) <br>
                •	Bone sonometry (assesses bone fragility) <br>
                •	Breast ultrasound (visualize breast tissue) <br>
                •	Doppler fetal heart rate monitors (to listen to the fetal heartbeat) <br>
                •	Doppler ultrasound (to visualize blood flow through blood vessels, organs, or other structures) <br>
                •	Echocardiogram (view the heart) <br>
                •	Fetal ultrasound (view fetus during pregnancy) <br>
                •	Ultrasound-guided biopsies (to collect sample of tissue) <br>
                •	Ophthalmic ultrasound (visualize ocular structures) <br>
                •	Ultrasound-guided needle placement <br>
                •	Kidney (renal) ultrasound (visualize the kidneys and related structures) <br>
                •	Pelvic ultrasound (visualize pelvic organs) <br>
                •	Transvaginal ultrasound (probe inserted into vaginal canal to view reproductive organs) <br>
                •	Thyroid ultrasound (visualize and assess the thyroid gland) <br>
                •	Transrectal ultrasound (probe inserted into the rectum to view rectum and nearby organs such as the prostate) <br>

            <p class="ctscan-header">Endoscope</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                An endoscopy is a procedure that allows doctors to visually examine inside of a patient’s body typically the digestive system.  
                The endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a powerful light source and tiny camera at the end. An endoscope can be inserted through the mouth, down the throat and into the esophagus or via the bottom through the rectum. 
                Doctors can then view images on a video monitor. The purpose of an endoscopy is to diagnose a disease or investigate symptoms, screen for and prevent cancer and give treatment. <br> <br>

                The endoscope is also used alongside keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). 
                The endoscope is passed into the body via a small incision made in the skin. 
                This enables healthcare providers to operate without having to make large cuts and reduces the time taken for healing to take place afterwards. <br> <br> 
                
                Another use of the endoscope is when a biopsy is taken from inside the body. 
                The forceps are passed into the body again via the endoscope and the surgeon then removes small samples of tissue for it to be examined more closely. <br> <br> 
                
                Healthcare providers will usually conduct an endoscopy to evaluate: <br>
                •	Stomach pain <br>
                •	Ulcers. Gastritis, or difficulty swallowing. <br>
                •	Digestive tract bleeding <br>
                •	Check changes in bowel habits (chronic constipation or diarrhea) <br>
                •	Polyps or growths in the colon  <br>
                •	Routine colon cancer screening <br> <br>
                
                Types of endoscopy include: <br> <br>
                
                •	Anoscopy – to view anus/rectum through the anus. <br>
                •	Arthroscopy – view joints through small incision over joint <br>
                •	Bronchoscopy – to view trachea/windpipe/lungs through the mouth.
                •	Colonoscopy – to view entire length of the colon and large intestine through the anus. <br>
                •	Colposcopy – to view vagina and cervix through vagina’s opening after a speculum dilates. <br>
                •	Cystoscopy – to view the inside of bladder through the urethra. <br>
                •	Esophagoscopy – to view esophagus through the mouth. <br>
                •	Gastroscopy – to view stomach and duodenum through the mouth. <br>
                •	Laparoscopy – to view stomach liver and other abdominal organs via a small surgical opening in the abdomen. <br>
                •	Laryngoscopy – to view the larynx (voice box) through the mouth. <br>
                •	Neuroendoscopy – to view areas of the brain through small incision in the skull. <br>
                •	Proctoscopy – to view rectum and sigmoid colon via the anus. <br>
                •	Sigmoidoscopy - to view sigmoid colon through the anus. <br>
                •	Thoracoscopy – to view the pleura (2 membranes covering lungs and lining chest cavity, and structures covering the heart) via a small surgical opening in chest. rubber

            <p class="ctscan-header">Implantable Pacemakers</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                A pacemaker is a small battery-powered medical device that is surgically implanted in the chest to send electrical signals to regulate heart rate and rhythm. 
                The device is used to treat abnormal heart rates or arrhythmia. 
                The device is usually placed in the chest below the collarbone and is used when the heart’s natural pacemaker (SA node) is not functioning properly, 
                causing slow heart rate or rhythm or if the electrical pathways are blocked. 
                The pacemaker can also be used to assist the heart chambers beat in sync so the heart can pump blood more efficiently to the body which may be needed if the patient has heart failure. <br> <br>

                Types of pacemakers: <br> 
                •	Single chamber pacemaker – sends electrical impulses to lower right chamber of the heart. <br>
                •	Dual chamber pacemaker – sends electrical impulses to both upper and lower right heart chambers. <br>
                •	Biventricular pacemaker – for patients with heart failure and a slow heartbeat. 
                The device stimulates both lower heart chambers (ventricles) and helps strength the heart muscle. <br>
                •	Leadless pacemaker – a new type of pacemaker where the device is implanted within the heart itself using a long, 
                thin tube (catheter) from a vein in the groin and does not use leads to stimulate the heart. <br> <br>

                A pacemaker may have two parts: <br>
                •	Pulse generator – a small metal box with a battery and electrical parts. It controls the rate of electrical impulses sent to the heart. <br>
                •	Leads – flexible and insulated wires that are placed in one or more of the heart chambers. 
                One to three wires are place and sends electrical signals to correct the irregular heartbeat. <br> <br>
                
                A pacemaker can be temporary (short-term) or permanent (long-term). A temporary pacemaker is normally inserted through a vein in the neck and remains outside of the body. 
                While a permanent pacemaker is placed in the chest or abdomen.

            <p class="ctscan-header">Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs)</p>

            <p class="ctscan-text">
                The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is a small battery powered device that is implanted under the skin in the upper chest. 
                The function of the device is to continuously monitor the heart rhythm, detect and prevent life-threatening arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF)) among patients who are highly susceptible to it. 
                The ICD protects patients from life-threatening emergencies such as death. 
                These defibrillators are invasive as they have to be surgically implanted into the patient's body and make direct contact with the heart. 
                When any abnormality in heart rhythm is detected, the device automatically calibrates the voltage and delivers the electrical shock to the heart muscles to restore the heart rhythm. <br> <br>

                The two basic types of ICDs: <br>
                •	Traditional ICD: placed in the chest and has leads that is attached to the heart. <br>
                •	Subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD):  placed under the skin at the side of the chest below the armpit. 
                This device uses a sensor called an electrode which runs along the breastbone. An S-ICD is larger that the traditional ICD and does not touch the heart. <br> <br>
                
                The ICD consist of two parts: <br>
                •	The first is a box which houses the battery, and a tiny computer called the pulse generator. 
                The battery stores energy needed for the device while the computer receives information from the leads to determine the heart rhythm. <br>
                •	The second are the wires connected from the box to the heart muscles called the leads. 
                The leads send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle as well as monitor the electrical activity of the heart. <br> <br>


                An ICD may be recommended if the patient has a history of coronary artery disease and survived a cardiac arrest (heart attack) that has weakened the heart muscles, 
                enlarged heart muscle or had a genetic heart condition that increases the risk of developing ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. 
                Examples include Brugada syndrome, long Q-T syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic VT.
