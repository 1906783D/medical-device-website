                CT scanners have a preventative maintenance schedule which is vital to maintaining its uptime. This includes: <br> 
                •	Checking the mechanical movements of the gantry and bed <br>
                •	Checking and cleaning of slip ring, brushes and fans <br>
                •	General dust cleaning <br> 
                •	Checking of the error log and device software <br>
                •	Testing and checking the system under operation. E.g. LEDs, batteries, messages, etc. are functioning as intended <br>
                •	Calibration of device <br>
                •	Image quality checks <br>
                •	Having a few tests patients <br>
                •	Adjusting exam protocols if needed by patients. <br>
                •	Maintaining of site environment such as room temperature and humidity <br>
                •	Checking of site conditions such as power supply and Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) <br>

                •	<u>Cleaning and Sanitization of ECG equipment:</u> Regular cleaning and disinfecting of ECG machine surface, electrodes, and cables to prevent build up of dirt and bacteria. <br>
                •	<u>Inspection of cables and electrodes:</u> checking for any signs of wear or damage on the electrodes and cables as this prevents signal loss or poor signal during the ECG test. <br>
                •	<u>Battery maintenance for battery-powered ECG machines:</u> Ensuring that the batteries are functioning and charged to prevent unexpected power loss during the ECG recording. <br>
                •	<u>Software Updates:</u> Ensuring that the software of the ECG machine is up to date. This includes bug fixes, improved functionality, and faster performance. <br>
                •	<u>Change of adhesive gel:</u> The adhesive gel on the electrodes will dry out over time which leads to poor conductivity. Regular replacement of the adhesive gel will ensure constant optimal signal recording. <br>
                •	<u>Voltage	calibration:</u> Adjusting the voltage setting of the ECG machine for accurate electrical signal recording. Prevents distortions in ECG waveform and accurate voltage measurements. <br>
                •	<u>Time calibration:</u> Ensures that the time intervals for the ECG waveform is recorded accurately. This is vital for precise and reliable heart rate measurement and analysis of the ECG waveform. <br>
                •	<u>Amplitude Calibration:</u> Ensuring that the height of the ECG waveform is represented accurately. This is important for reading the ECG voltage measurements as well as for abnormalities identification. <br>
                •	<u>Frequency calibration:</u> Adjusting the filter settings in the ECG machine. This eliminates noise and prevents interferences from being recorded in the ECG. <br>
