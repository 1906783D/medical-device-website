                A pacemaker is checked periodically to assess the battery and leads, and any adjustments will be done by either a cardiologist or cardiac technician. <br> <br>

                Long term follow-up and maintenance of the Implantable pacemaker after surgical implantation: <br> 
                •	Patients will need to check the wound 1 week after the implantation.  <br>
                •	clinic device and wound surveillance done by healthcare providers will typically be done 6 weeks after implantation. <br>
                •	Routine device clinic checks done by physicians typically is done every 4-6 months. 
                The check will include a noninvasive review of the pacemaker parameters, function and cardiac events will be printed and recorded. 
                The review will take approximately 20 minutes and conducted by the programmer using a “wand” placed on the chest over the pacemaker. <br>
                •	Patients should always carry a device identification card. <br>
                •	In the case of detecting a battery depletion issue, which can be determined during the routine device checks.

                In terms of long term follow up: 
                Initially patients will have to attend checks every 4 to 6 weeks intervals to check the ICD function and if there are no issues, 
                follow up intervals may be increased to every 3 months or more. <br> <br>

                The typical battery life of an Implantable cardioverter defibrillator is six to eight years depending on how much energy is used to regularly restore the heart rhythm and if shocks are needed. 
                The device has a battery indicator to signal when the battery life has around three months left.
